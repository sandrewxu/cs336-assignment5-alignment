      "\n",
      "1. First, we need to calculate the difference between 12 noon and 2:30 PM in seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are \\(12 \\times 3600 = 43200\\) seconds in 2 hours (which is 2 PM). Since 2:30 PM is 30 minutes after 2 PM, which is \\(30 \\times 60 = 1800\\) seconds, the total time between 12 Noon and 2:30 PM is \\(43200 + 1800 = 45000\\) seconds.\n",
      "2. Next, we need to subtract this time from 7200 seconds to find out how much time is left until they arrive at their destination. So, we subtract 7200 seconds from 45000 seconds. (Using the concept of clock arithmetic, we can handle the seconds directly.)\n",
      "3. Finally, we add the remaining time to 12 noon to find out the arrival time.\n",
